title: Phrase
---

`<intl-phrase>` components resolve a phrase from the `<intl-dictionary>`. Phrase elements require a `name` attribute, which is a key to a phrase stored in the dictionary. `name` attributes can also be a `dot.separated.string`, which acts as a serialized accessor, reaching into objects and pulling out the given phrase.

More documentation will be coming soon.
