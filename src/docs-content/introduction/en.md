Please note that `intl` is an experimental technology, and until it reaches a more stable state, documentation may be sparse and breaking changes may be frequent. 

In the meantime, you are invited to read [the source](https://github.com/intl-wc/intl/tree/master/packages/core) for a better understanding of the project components.

More documentation will be coming soon.
