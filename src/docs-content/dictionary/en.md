title: Dictionary
---

The `<intl-dictionary>` component automatically loads translation files, observes the `<html>` element for mutations to `lang` or `dir`, and manages phrase loading.

It's recommended to place your app's `<intl-dictionary>` component in the root of the `<body>` element, as a *sibling* to your application's root node. Other setups may or may not work, but are explicity unsupported, so proceed at your own risk!

More documentation will be coming soon.
